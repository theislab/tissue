## Installation

You can install _Tissue_ via :

```console
$ git clone tissue
$ cd tissue
$ pip install -e .
```

## Requirements

You can install the requirements via:

```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The repository consists of different components

I. Data loading: datasets can be defined under `data/datasets.py` and pytorch geometric dataloaders are adjusted accordingly in `data/loading.py`

II. Models: graph neural networks and baseline models as described in the paper, the following models can be found under `modules/`:
#### Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
1. Graph convolutional network (GCN)
2. Graph isomorphism network (GIN)
4. Graph attention network (GAT)


**1. Spatial Tissue Architecture**
- Graph-based models (GIN, GCN)


**2. Graph statistics**
- Density-based models

**3. Single Cell**
- Multiple-instance models

**4. Bulk**
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest



The models can be trained using the training scripts provided under `train/`.

III. Summary and evaluation of models: model evaluation and plotting functions are defined in `train/summaries.py`

IV. Model interpretation: interpretation methods on graph and node embedding levels are implemented under `interpretation/`
