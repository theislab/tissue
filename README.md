# Tissue



## Features

tissue is a model repository in a single python package for the manuscript Fischer, D. S., Ali, M., Richter, S., Etr√ºrk, A. and Theis, F. "Graph neural networks learn emergent tissue properties from spatial molecular profiles."

## Installation

You can install _Tissue_ via :

```console
$ git clone tissue
$ cd tissue
$ pip install -e .
```

## Requirements

You can install the requirements via:

```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The repository consists of different components

I. Data loading: datasets can be defined under `data/datasets.py` and pytorch geometric dataloaders are adjusted accordingly in `data/loading.py`

II. Models: graph neural networks and baseline models as described in the paper, the following models can be found under `modules/`:
#### GNN
1. Graph convolutional network (GCN)
2. Graph isomorphism network (GIN)
3. GCN with self-supervision (GCN-SS)
4. Graph attention network (GAT)

#### Baseline models
**Scenario 1: Mean node features models**
1. Multi-Layer Preceptron (MLP)
2. Random Forest
3. Logistic regression

**Scenario 2: Single cell/cell type models**
1. Multi-instance (MI) on single cell level
2. Aggregation multi-instance (AGG) on cell type level

**Scenario 3: Spatial models**
1. Graph neural network without node features
2. Node degree models (random forest and/or logistic regression)
3. Dispersion model

The models can be trained using the training scripts provided under `train/`.

III. Summary and evaluation of models: model evaluation and plotting functions are defined in `train/summaries.py`

IV. Model interpretation: interpretation methods on graph and node embedding levels are implemented under `interpretation/`


## Tutorial
We have provided an analysis [tutorial notebook](https://github.com/theislab/tissue/blob/main/tutorial/codex_celltype.ipynb) for one of the dataset used in the study.
